## Thermal Distribution Simulation

This project simulates real-time heat distribution on a 2D grid. OpenCL is used to accelerate temperature updates and color mapping directly on the GPU, allowing large grids to run smoothly.  
Perlin Noise is used to initialize the temperature and diffusion maps for more realistic patterns. The Qt interface displays the heatmap along with FPS and backend update time.

**Technologies:** C++, Qt, OpenCL, Perlin Noise.
